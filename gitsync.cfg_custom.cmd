:: If your project does not have such a file, and buildVersionAutomated=empty, your will be prompted for a version == not unattended
:: setting up buildVersionAutomated=x.y.z avoids this prompt pause, if you want this script to be fully unattended and not have a projectConfig file

set textFiles=*.txt *.txt *.cmd *.bat *.pl *.py *.awk *.ps1 *.ini *.cfg *.sql *.xml *.yml *.yaml *.conf *.config *.json *.properties

:: doUnix2dos will process textFiles with busybox unix2dos before :local_backup
:: That is, if busybox.exe is present on your system in %PATH%
:: This will reset the Archive attribute and the modified time
